==============

Monitors a website for changes

This will be a series of scripts that will monitor a website. 
This is accomplished by crawling the site, comparing the site 
to a cached copy, writing any changes to a text file, and 
coping the cache and change file text to a new directory for archiving.

Prerequisites:

Make sure the below are installed on your system.

1) urlwatch
2) sed
3) wget

This is a work in progress.
